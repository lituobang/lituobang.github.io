The Code of Hammurabi remains the earliest relatively complete written code of law known to date. In the societal structures of the Roman Republic and the Ancient Greek city-states, the social status of <strong>Consuls/Magistrates</strong> exceeded that of the <strong>Nobility</strong>, and the social status of <strong>Scholars</strong>—those responsible for exploring truth—was lower than both. Consuls typically simultaneously served as judges and administrative chiefs.</p>
                <p data-key="p_theocracy">The Roman Republic transitioned into the Roman Empire in $27$ BC. Around the $4^{th}$ century AD, Constantine I established Christianity as the state religion, transforming the state into a theocracy. From that point until the Renaissance, the social structure in Europe was typically <strong>Clergy</strong> > <strong>Nobility</strong> > <strong>Merchants</strong>. The role of the clergy essentially replaced the role of the judge previously held by the Consuls, which is the origin of the modern separation of administrative and judicial powers. The clergy, having combined law and religion, developed a series of canon laws, and were therefore typically well-versed in Roman law. The clergy, having combined law and religion, developed a series of canon laws, and were therefore typically well-versed in Roman law. During this period, some members of the clergy often utilized their professional convenience to undertake the work of scholars. Consequently, although members of the clergy were not always scholars, most had profound legal backgrounds, and scholars were usually members of the clergy, also possessing deep legal backgrounds. The academic development fostered by the church led to the establishment of the earliest universities in Italy and France during the $11^{th}$ and $12^{th}$ centuries.</p>

                p_roman_greece: "古罗马的文明起源于古希腊文明，古希腊文明又起源于古巴比伦文明。古巴比伦国王颁布的汉谟拉比法典是至今为止最早的较为完整的成文法典。罗马共和国和古希腊城邦的社会结构是执政官大于贵族，负责探索真理的学者的社会地位则低于前两者。执政官通常同时承担法官和行政长官的职责。",
                p_theocracy: "罗马共和国在公元前$27$年转为罗马帝国，在公元$4$世纪左右，罗马帝国的君士坦丁一世将基督教定为国教，转型为一个政教合一的国家。从那以后，直到文艺复兴，欧洲地区的社会结构都是<strong>神职人员</strong> > <strong>贵族</strong> > <strong>商人</strong>。这里的神职人员其实替代了此前执政官中法官的角色，而行政长官的角色则由贵族担任，也是现代行政权和司法权分立的起源。神职人员将法律和宗教结合，发展出一系列的教法，所以神职人员通常是熟读罗马法的。在这一段时间中，部分神职人员通常也利用职务便利承担着学者的工作。同时由于共和国体制瓦解，普通公民中再难有学者出现，所以虽然神职人员不一定是学者，但大都有深厚的法学背景，而学者通常都是神职人员，也有深厚的法学背景。",

                p_technical_vs_institutional: "尤其是在理工科和新兴交叉学科中，不少研究人员接受的是<strong>“工程式训练”</strong>（technical training），但缺乏<strong>“制度式训练”</strong>（institutional training）。他们可能具备操作实验的能力，但并未接受过学术规范训练。 这导致他们当中的有些人试图去挑战这些源于罗马法的，已经沿用近千年并创造出无数灿烂成果，诞生了工业文明的制度。",

                p_academic_egalitarianism: "近些年，学术界开始出现一种声音，认为代表作制度是落后的，声称现代科学成果越来越依赖大集体合作。他们提倡推行<strong>学术平均主义</strong>——只要署名了，贡献就一样。这种趋势导致了各种形式的<strong>共同一作</strong>和<strong>共同通讯作者</strong>，随后是<strong>全体一作</strong>，按姓氏字母排序，甚至有人建议作者列表采用环形排列。",
